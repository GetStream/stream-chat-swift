# The official iOS SDK for [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/ios/)

The **StreamChatUI SDK**  is the official iOS SDK for [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/ios/), a service for building chat and messaging applications.

---

## Which Version Should I Choose?

- **4.x** is the current production version. (Recommended)
- **3.x** is the previous production version and in maintenance mode.
- **2.x** is in maintenance mode.

## Main Features

- **Uses `UIKit` patterns and paradigms:** The API follows the design of native system SDKs. It makes integration with your existing code easy and familiar.
- **First-class support for `Combine`**
- **Offline support:** Browse channels and send messages while offline.
- **Familiar behavior**: The UI elements are good platform citizens and behave like native elements; they respect `tintColor`, `layoutMargins`, light/dark mode, dynamic font sizes, etc.
- **Swift native API:** Uses Swift's powerful language features to make the SDK usage easy and type-safe.
- **Fully open-source implementation:** You have access to the complete source code of the SDK here on GitHub.
- **Supports iOS 11+, Swift 5.2:** We proudly support older versions of iOS, so your app can stay available to almost everyone.

## Free for Makers

Stream is free for most side and hobby projects. You can use Stream Chat for free if you have less than five team members and no more than $10,000 in monthly revenue.

## Main Principles

* **Progressive disclosure:** The SDK can be used easily with very minimal knowledge of it. As you become more familiar with it, you can dig deeper and start customizing it on all levels.

* **Highly customizable:** Every element is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify the brand color by setting `tintColor`, apply appearance changes using custom UI rules, or subclass existing elements and inject them everywhere in the system, no matter how deep is the logic heirarchy.

* **`open` by default:** Everything is `open` unless there's a strong reason for it to not be. This means you can easily modify almost every behavior of the SDK such that it fits your needs.

* **Good platform citizen:** The UI elements behave like good platform citizens. They use existing iOS patterns; their beahavior is predictable and matches system UI components; they respect `tintColor`, `layourMargins`, dynamic font sizes, and other system-defined UI constants.
