## Swift/iOS Chat Tutorial

The best place to start is the [iOS Swift Chat Tutorial](https://getstream.io/tutorials/ios-chat/). It teaches you how to use this SDK and also shows how to make common changes. 

## Clone the Github Example App

This repo includes a fully functional example app. You can run the example app by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have Xcode 11 installed and that it has latest components installed (open Xcode and install any pending update)
2. Download the StreamChat repo: `git clone git@github.com:GetStream/stream-chat-swift.git`
3. Change the directory: `cd stream-chat-swift/Example/Cocoapods`
4. Install the [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html): `sudo gem install cocoapods`
5. Install dependencies: `pod install --repo-update`

## Docs

You'll typically want to start out using the UI components, and implement your own components using the Swift Chat API as needed.

* [Swift Chat API Docs](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/swift/)
* [Low level core API Reference](https://getstream.github.io/stream-chat-swift/core/)

## Requirements

- iOS 11+
- Xcode 11.2+
- Swift 5.1
- CocoaPods 1.7+
- Carthage 0.33.0+

## Installation

Stream Chat SDK consists of two frameworks: `StreamChat` and `StreamChatCore`

- `StreamChat` — the full SDK library with all UI components. Styling and deep customizations are all supported out of the box.
- `StreamChatCore` — low-level library to use Stream Chat APIs. It includes models, presenters, notification manager and HTTP interface.

### CocoaPods

To integrate StreamChat into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add this entry in your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'StreamChat'
```

Then run `pod install`.

If you want to use only `StreamChatCore`, you can add this entry in your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'StreamChatCore'
```

In any file you'd like to use Stream Chat in, don't forget to import the frameworks:

```
import StreamChat
```

**or** `StreamChatCore` if you are working with the low-level client:

```
import StreamChatCore
```

### Carthage

To integrate Stream Chat into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "GetStream/stream-chat-swift"
```

Then run: `carthage update --platform iOS --new-resolver`. This will build frameworks: `StreamChatCore.framework` and `StreamChat.framework` into `<Path to your Project>/Carthage/Build/iOS/` from where you can add them to your project and link them with your app target. Follow with these steps:

- Open your Xcode project
- Select the project in the Navigator
- Select your app target
- Open `General` panel
- Open `<Path to your Project>/Carthage/Build/iOS/` in Finder and find `StreamChatCore.framework`, drag and drop it into `Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Content` area in Xcode. Do the same for `StreamChat.framework` if you need UI components.
- After adding libraries, select "Do Not Embed" option in "Embed" section. (Right next to the library name after adding it)
- Open `Build Phases` panel in Xcode
- Click the `+` button and select `New Run Script Phase`
- Set the content to: `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`  
- Add to `Input Files`:
  - `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/StreamChatCore.framework`
  - `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/StreamChat.framework` (if you need UI components)
- Add to `Output Files`:
  - `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/StreamChatCore.framework`
  - `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/StreamChat.framework` (if you need UI components)
  
Now you can build your app and use `StreamChat`.
