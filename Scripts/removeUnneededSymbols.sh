# Usage: ./removeUnneededSymbols.sh StreamChatUI ./Products
#
# Creating an xcframework for StreamChatUI generates a .bcsymbolmap file for itself, and one for
# each of its dependencies too (eg. StreamChat). That means that we will end up having something like:
#
# -> StreamChatUI/BCSymbolMaps/
#                              <UUID-StreamChatUI>.bcsymbolmap
#                              <UUID-StreamChat>.bcsymbolmap
# -> StreamChat/BCSymbolMaps/
#                              <UUID-StreamChat>.bcsymbolmap
#
# When adding both StreamChat and StreamChatUI to an app, it will throw an error when trying to compile
# saying that there are multiple executions producing the same file (<UUID-StreamChat>.bcsymbolmap).
#
# This script will remove duplicated .bcsymbolmap in the generated xcframeworks.
# If we countinue with the same example, it will leave it as follows:
#
# -> StreamChatUI/BCSymbolMaps/
#                              <UUID-StreamChatUI>.bcsymbolmap
# -> StreamChat/BCSymbolMaps/
#                              <UUID-StreamChat>.bcsymbolmap
#
# Each xcframework only contains its symbols now.
