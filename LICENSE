CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY LOST DATA AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING

will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision
to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining
provisions will continue in full force and effect. Customer shall not violate
