/// Generates a name for the given channel, given the current user's id.
///
/// The priority order is:
/// - Assigned name of the channel, if not empty
/// - If the channel is direct message (implicit cid):
///   - Name generated from cached members of the channel
/// - Channel's id
///
/// Examples:
/// - If channel has some name, ie. `Channel 1`, this returns `Channel 1`
/// - If channel has no name and is not direct message, this returns channel ID of the channel
/// - If channel is direct message, has no name and has members where there just 2,
/// returns name of the members in alphabetic order: `Leia, Luke`
/// - If channel is direct message, has no name and has members where there are more than 2,
/// returns name of the members in alphabetic order with how many members left: `Leia, Luke and 5 others`
///  - If channel is direct message, has no name and no members, this returns `nil`
///  - If channel is direct message, has no name and only one member, shows the one member name
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - maxMemberNames: Maximum number of visible members in Channel defaults to `2`
///   - separator: Separator of the members, defaults to `y`
/// - Returns: A closure with 2 parameters carrying `channel` used for name generation and `currentUserId` to decide
/// which members' names are going to be displayed
