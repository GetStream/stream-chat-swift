/// Observers the storage for attachments in a `.pendingUpload` state and uploads data from `localURL` to backend.
///
/// Uploading of the attachment has the following phases:
///     1. When an attachment with `pendingUpload` state local state appears in the db,
///     the uploaded enqueues it in the uploading queue.
///     2. When the attachment is being uploaded, its local state reflects the progress `.uploading(progress: [0, 1])`.
///     The message state is also updated so FRC receive message updates when attachments are changed.
///     3. If the operation is successful the local state of the attachment is changed to `.uploaded`.
///     If the operation fails the local state is set to `.uploadedFailed`.

/// - Upload attachments in order declared by `locallyCreatedAt`
