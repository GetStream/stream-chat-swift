/// itself. When the object is malformed, it assignes the object to base as `nil` value
/// When the value is not corrupted somehow, it stores into base and we can use it.

/// Use this when you are decoding objects in array and there is possibility
/// that some of the objects can be malformed in JSON. Then you should `compactMap` the array
/// For example usage, see `MessagePayload.swift` `init(from decoder:)`
