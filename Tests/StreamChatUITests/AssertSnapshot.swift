/// - Parameters:
///   - vc: The view controller to be tested.

///   - screenSize: The size of the view controller.
///   - suffix: When multiple snapshots are recorded from within the same test, the suffix will be added
///   to the name of the snapshot image file to uniquely identify it.
///   - record: True if a new reference should be saved. False by default,
///   so that the newly captured snapshot is compared with the current reference.
