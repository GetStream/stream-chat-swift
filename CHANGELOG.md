### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Set user will return a `Result<UserConnection, ClientError>` in callback. `UserConnection` has the current user data, connection id and unread count for channels and messages [#182](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/182).

### üîÑ Changed
- `Pagination` doesn't support `+` operator anymore, please use a set of  `PaginationOption`s from now on [#158](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/158).
- `channel.subscribeToWatcherCount` uses channel events to publish updated counts and does not call `channel.watch` as a side-effect anymore [#161](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/161).
- Subscriptions for a channel unread count and watcher count [#172](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/172).
- Changed a returning type for requests as `Cancellable` instead of `URLSessionTask` to make requests and events more consistent [#172](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/172).
- The example project was updated [#172](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/172).

### ‚úÖ Added
- Message preparation callback on `ChannelPresenter` to modify messages before they're sent [#142](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/142).
- Better errors when developers forget to call `set(user:)` or don't wait for its completion [#160](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/160).
- Examples for a channel unread count and watcher count in the Example app [#172](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/172).

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/2.0.0)
_April 2, 2020_

### StreamChat 2.0 here and it's brand new :sparkles: :rocket:

We've added/removed/fixed/changed a lot of stuff, so it's fair to say that StreamChat 2.0 is everything you've liked about 1.x and nothing you didn't like about it :smile:

Most importantly:
- We have a brand new framework: `StreamChatClient`, that you can use to easily integrate StreamChat into your app without any Presenter or UI logic we have in `StreamChatCore` and `StreamChat` libraries.
  - `StreamChatClient` has minimal dependencies and it's very low level.
  - No Reactive dependencies! Everything is handled in good old callbacks.
  - No reactive makes you sad? StreamChatCore still has all the reactive functionality you'd expect, so you can keep using RxSwift if you want!
- We've updated our dependencies, and removed some.

Aside from those, we fixed tons of bugs and polished our API. Now it should be more Swifty :tada:

We're working hard on migration guide for our 1.x users and will publish it shortly.
You can check out updated docs [here](http://getstream.io/chat/docs/)
