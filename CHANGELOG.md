_June 12, 2020_

### ‚úÖ Added
- `ClientLogger.showConnectionErrorAlert` flag to control showing the UI alert for WebSocket errors. It's turned off by default. [#303](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/303)

### üîÑ Changed
- Calling `Client.configureShared` with the same config more than once does not cause assertion failure. This is still discouraged and should not be done, and will not take affect. Calling it with different configs will still cause assertion failure. [#313](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/313)
   Note: Changing `apiKey` only is possible via `Client.shared.apiKey`

### üêû Fixed
- `Channel.team` not being correctly encoded for multi-tenant enabled clients [#308](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/308)

- Fixed the default background color for a placeholder image or when the image wasn't loaded to make the size of it visible [#310](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/310).
- Fixed height rendering for a message for messages with a single line [#310](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/310).
- Fixed rendering of a message bubble curve more precisely [#310](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/310).
- Fixed scrolling to the current message when you go to the last page [#310](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/310).
- Fix ChannelsPresenter not respecting filter for new created/added channels [#313](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/313)

# [2.2.3](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/2.2.3)
_June 05, 2020_

### ‚úÖ Added
- Support new regions: Singapore and Sydney. [#293](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/293)
- `disableLocalNotifications` added to `Notifications` for disabling local notifications [#290](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/290)
- Send a keystroke event for the current user: `channel.keystroke {}`. The method will automatically send a typing stop event after 15 seconds after the last call of `keystroke()`. [#281](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/281)
- Send a stop typing event for the current user: `stopTyping {}`. Usually, you don't need to call this method directly. [#281](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/281)
- Automatically send a `typingStop` event if it's not received in 30 seconds after the latest `typingStart` event [#282](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/282).
- Add support for multi-tenancy. Refer to [docs](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/multi_tenant_chat/?language=swift) for more info [#295](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/295)

### üîÑ Changed
- Unknown user is not used anymore. By default the current user is anonymous (you can check this with `isAnonymous`). Anyway you can't connect without `set(user:token:)` or `setGuestUser(user:)` or `setAnonymousUser()` [#284](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/284).
- You can subscribe to events as soon as the client is configured. This means that your subscriptions will work until the client disconnect (user login/logout) and until you cancel subscriptions [#284](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/284).

### üêû Fixed
- Fixed `rx.connectionState` observation when a user logged out and login again [#284](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/284).
- Fixed updates not happening in `ChannelPresenter` initialized with `ChannelResponse` and queryOptions containing `.watch` [#301](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/301)

_May 27, 2020_

### ‚úÖ Added
- Re-introduced `Filter.none`. It should not be used with queryChannels or search, it's only valid for queryUsers to get all users [#285](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/285)
- `Filter.contains` operator for all endpoints [#285](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/285)
- `Filter.custom` to be able to use new operators before our SDK is updated [#285](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/285)
  Please make sure to provide a valid operator.
  Example:  `.custom("contains", key: "teams", value: "red")`
- `queryUsers` now supports `Pagination.limit` and `Pagination.offset` [#288](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/288)

# [2.2.1](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/2.2.1)
_May 19, 2020_

### ‚úÖ Added
- Added `ClientLogger.iconEnabled`, `ClientLogger.dateEnabled`, and `ClientLogger.levelEnabled` to control what will be shown in logs.
  These will only be valid when `ClientLogger.logger` block is not customized (overridden) [#263](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/263)
- `silent` property added to messages, see docs [here](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/silent_messages/?language=swift) [#264](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/264)
- Added option to show message replies also in channel, just like Slack [#271](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/271).
- A new view style for a reply in a channel `ComposerViewStyle.ReplyInChannelViewStyle`. You can set this style to nil for your `composerViewStyle` to disable this feature  [#271](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/271).

### üîÑ Changed
- `ClientLogger.logger` is deprecated, please use `ClientLogger.log` block to customize your log output [#263](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/263)
- Logs will now output log level, access it when overriding `ClientLogger.log` block [#263](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/263)
- By default, logs will not output emoji icons anymore, but all logs will now output date [#263](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/263)

### üêû Fixed
- `set(user:)` is not required for query (channels, users) unless `presence: true` or `state: true` is specified [#269](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/269)
- Disabled context menu for deleted messages:  [#241](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/271).
- Fix crash in iOS12 caused by abstract URLSession instance [#272](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/272)
- Fix infinite loop when the web socket connection fails (iOS13 only) [#273](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/273).
- Direct message channels (1-by-1 channels) will correctly get their name and avatar image from other user [#275](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/275).
 ```swift
 let anotherUser = User(id: "second")
anotherUser.name = "John"
anotherUser.avatarURL = URL(string: "http://example.com/john")

let channel = client.channel(members: [client.user, anotherUser])
print(channel.name) // will print "John"
print(channel.imageURL) // will print "http://example.com/john"
```

# [2.2.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/2.2.0)
_May 08, 2020_

### ‚úÖ Added
- `avatarViewStyle` under `ChatViewStyle` for customizing Navigation Right Bar Button Item avatar [#241](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/241).
- `logAssert(_:_:)` and `logAssertionFailure(_:)` functions added to `ClientLogger` [#231](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/231).
- Support built-in WebSockets protocol in iOS 13+ using  `URLSessionWebSocketTask` [#240](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/240).
- `queryChannels` now returns unread count of each channel, unrestricted by number of messages fetched [#247](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/247):
  Example:
  ```swift
  Client.shared.queryChannels(filter: .currentUserInMembers, sort: [Sorting("has_unread", isAscending: false)]) { (result) in
      for response in result.value! {
          print("Channel \(response.channel.name ?? "nil"), unread messages count: \(response.channel.unreadCount.messages)")
      }
  }
  ```

### üîÑ Changed
- Configuring the shared `Client` using the static `Client.config` variable has been deprecated. Please create an instance of the `Client.Config` struct and call `Client.configureShared(_:)` to set up the shared instance of `Client` [#231](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/231).
  ```swift
  // Deprecated:
  Client.config = .init(apiKey: apiKey, logOptions: .info)

  // Preferred:
  var config = Client.Config(apiKey: apiKey)
  config.logOptions = .info
  Client.configureShared(config)
  ```

  **Reasoning:** In the original implementation, when `Client.shared` was accessed for the first time, its initializer used the current value of `Client.config`. In more complex situations, this approach could cause hard-to-debug race-condition bugs when `Client.shared` was initialized before its configuration was fully finished. The newly introduced `Client.configureShared(_:)` function makes the client configuration explicit.

- `Client.shared` triggers assertion failure when used without configuring [#231](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/231).
- `Client.Config` triggers assertion failure when created with an empty API key value [#231](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/231).
- Assigning an empty string to `Client.apiKey` triggers assertion failure [#231](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/231).
- Changed title of camera upload button from _Upload from a camera_ to _Upload from camera_ [#239](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/239).
- Deprecated 2 public initializers from `UploadingItem` [#239](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/239):
  ```swift
  public init(attachment:previewImage:previewImageGifData:)
  ```
  and
  ```swift
  public init(attachment:fileName:)
  ```
  since they were unused. Please use `init(channel:url:)` initializer. 
- `Atomic.get(default: T) -> T` function was deprecated for non-optional `T` [#241](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/241)
- `Atomic.get()` no longer returns an optional type if the wrapped type itself is not optional  [#241](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/241)
- `Atomic.init(_:)` requires the initial value for non-optional `T` [#241](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/241)
- `Atomic.DidSetCallback` signature changed from `(_ value: T?, _ oldValue: T?) -> Void` to `(_ value: T, _ oldValue: T) -> Void` [#241](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/241)

### üêû Fixed
- Fix rx observing for the connection state [#249](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/249).
- Images taken directly from camera do not fail to upload [#236](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/236).
- Video uploads are now working, videos are treated as files [#239](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/239).
- Files over 20MB will correctly show file size warning [#239](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/239).
- Fix last message not set when sending first message to an empty channel [#246](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/246).
- Show in logs if extra data decoding failed for the `User` or `Channel` [#238](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/238).
- Recover the default extra data for User and Channel types [#238](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/238).
- Crashes on `channel.rx.events` and `channel.rx.unreadCount` [#248](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/248).
- It's now possible to access `Atomic` value within its own `update { }` block [#251](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/251)
- Fixed warning in AutoCancellingSubscription [#256](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/256)

func deleteFile(url: URL, channel: Channel, _ completion: @escaping Client.Completion<EmptyData> = { _ in }) -> Cancellable
```

### üîÑ Changed

```
`ChannelsViewController`:
```swift
open func updateChannelCellAvatarView(in cell: ChannelTableViewCell, channel: Channel)
```
`ChatViewController`:

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/2.0.0)
_April 2, 2020_

### StreamChat 2.0 here and it's brand new :sparkles: :rocket:

We've added/removed/fixed/changed a lot of stuff, so it's fair to say that StreamChat 2.0 is everything you've liked about 1.x and nothing you didn't like about it :smile:

Most importantly:
- We have a brand new framework: `StreamChatClient`, that you can use to easily integrate StreamChat into your app without any Presenter or UI logic we have in `StreamChatCore` and `StreamChat` libraries.
  - `StreamChatClient` has minimal dependencies and it's very low level.
  - No Reactive dependencies! Everything is handled in good old callbacks.
  - No reactive makes you sad? StreamChatCore still has all the reactive functionality you'd expect, so you can keep using RxSwift if you want!
- We've updated our dependencies, and removed some.

Aside from those, we fixed tons of bugs and polished our API. Now it should be more Swifty :tada:

We're working hard on migration guide for our 1.x users and will publish it shortly.
You can check out updated docs [here](http://getstream.io/chat/docs/)
