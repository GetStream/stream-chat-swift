### üêû Fixed

- Fix the timestamp label being clipped when the text font size is larger [#2575](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/2575)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue
When changing the text accessibility while the app is running, it won't affect the message cell text, only after closing the app. So this is a regression of [#2325](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/2325). This regression is necessary, since the original fix did not work 100% as it changed the text font size after closing the app, causing the font to be too big when the text accessibility is set to large. If you still want to have the dynamic font size to be working while the app is running, there is a workaround. You need to return a new `UIFont` instance everytime in `ChatMessageContentView.defaultMessageFont`. Example:
```swift
override var defaultMessageFont: UIFont {
    UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
}
```
For more details, you can read the documentation of `ChatMessageContentView.defaultMessageFont` or read the PR [#2575](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/2575).

### üö® Minor Breaking Changes
Although we don't usually ship breaking changes in minor releases, in some cases where they are minimal and important, we have to do them to keep improving the SDK long-term. Either way, these changes are for advanced customizations which won't affect most of the customers.

- The `ImageCDN` protocol has some minor breaking changes that were needed to support the new Stream CDN v2 and to make it more scalable in the future.
  - `urlRequest(forImage:)` -> `urlRequest(forImageUrl:resize:)`.
  - `cachingKey(forImage:)` -> `cachingKey(forImageUrl:)`.
  - Removed `thumbnail(originalURL:preferreSize:)`. This is now handled by `urlRequest(forImageUrl:resize:)` as well. If your CDN does not support resizing, you can ignore the resize parameter.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes from `4.0-beta.11`
- JSON Encoding/Decoding for both Network and Database date formatting changed to RFC3339 formats [#1403](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1403)
- `ChatMessage.threadParticipants` is now an Array instead of Set [#1398](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1398)
- Introduces `ChatChannelVC` and removes responsibilities of `ChatMessageListVC`. The latter now is only responsible to render the message list layout, the data is provided by `ChatChannelVC` or `ChatThreadVC`. [#1314](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1314)
- Replaces `ChatMessageActionsVC.Delegate` with `ChatMessageActionsVCDelegate` [#1314](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1314)
- Renames `ChatChannelListRouter.showMessageList()` -> `showChannel()` [#1314](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1314)
- Removal of `ComposerVCDelegate` [#1314](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1314)
- Replaces `ChatMessageListKeyboardObserver` with `ComposerKeyboardHandler` [#1314](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1314)

#### Understanding `ChatChannelVC` vs `ChatTheadVC` vs `ChatMessageListVC`
- `ChatChannelVC`:
    - `ChatChannelHeaderView`
    - `ChatMessageListVC`
    - `ComposerVC`

- `ChatThreadVC`:
    - `ChatThreadHeaderView`
    - `ChatMessageListVC`
    - `ComposerVC`

A new `ChatChannelVC` is introduced that represents the old `ChatMessageListVC`, which was responsible to display the messages from a channel. The `ChatThreadVC` remains the same and it is responsible for displaying the replies in a thread, but now instead of duplicating the implementation from the channel, both use the `ChatMessageListVC` and configure it for their needs. For this to be possible the `ChatMessageListVC` has now a `ChatMessageListVCDataSource` and `ChatMessageListVCDelegate`. Both `ChatChannelVC` and `ChatThreadVC` implement the `ChatMessageListVCDataSource` and `ChatMessageListVCDelegate`.

# [4.0.0-beta.9](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta.9)
_August 05, 2021_

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes from `4.0-beta.8`
- Extra data is now stored on a hashmap and not using the `ExtraData` generic system
- `ChatMessageLayoutOptionsResolver.optionsForMessage` has a new parameter: `appearance` [#1304](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/1304)
- Renamed `Components.navigationTitleView` -> `Components.titleContainerView` [#1294](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1294)

#### New Extra Data Type

The new `4.0` release changes how `extraData` is stored and uses a simpler hashmap-based solution. This approach does not require creating type aliases for all generic classes such as `ChatClient`.

Example:

```swift
client.connectUser(
    userInfo: .init(
        id: userCredentials.id,
        extraData: ["country": .string("NL")]
    ),
    token: token
)
```

`Message`, `User`, `Channel`, `MessageReaction` models now store `extraData` in a `[String: RawJSON]` container.

```swift
let extraData:[String: RawJSON] = .dictionary([
    "name": .string(testPayload.name),
    "number": .integer(testPayload.number)
])
```

#### Upgrading from ExtraData

If you are using `ExtraData` from `v3` or before `4.0-beta.8` the steps needed to upgrade are the following:

- Remove all type aliases (`typealias ChatUser = _ChatUser<CustomExtraDataTypes.User>`)
- Replace all generic types from `StreamChat` and `StreamChatUI` classes (`__CurrentChatUserController<T>` -> `CurrentChatUserController`) with the non-generic version
- Remove the extra data structs and either use `extraData` directly or (recommended) extend the models
- Update your views to read your custom fields from the `extraData` field

Before:

```swift
struct Birthland: UserExtraData {
    static var defaultValue = Birthland(birthLand: "")
    let birthLand: String
}
```

After:

```swift
extension ChatUser {
    static let birthLandFieldName = "birthLand"
    var birthLand: String {
        guard let v = extraData[ChatUser.birthLandFieldName] else {
            return ""
        }
        guard case let .string(birthLand) = v else {
            return ""
        }
        return birthLand
    }
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes from `4.0-beta.4`
- The `ChatSuggestionsViewController` was renamed to `ChatSuggestionsVC` to follow the rest of the codebase. [#1195](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1195)
- The `CreateChatChannelButton` component was removed. The component acted only as a placeholder and the functionality should be always provided by the hosting app. For an example implementation see the [Demo app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/blob/main/DemoApp/ChatPresenter.swift).
- The payload of `AnyChatMessageAttachment` changed from `Any` to `Data` [#1248](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1248).
- The user setting API was updated. It's now required to call one of the available `connect` methods on `ChatClient` after `ChatClient`'s instance is created in order to establish connection and set the current user.

  Migration tips:
  ---
  If you were doing:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: .static(token))
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  client.connectUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId), token: token)
  ```
  ---
  Guest users before:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(
    config: config,
    tokenProvider: .guest(
      userId: userId,
      name: userName
    )
  )
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  client.connectGuestUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId))
  ```
  ---
  Anonymous users before:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: .anonymous)
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  client.connectAnonymousUser()
  ```
  ---
  If you use tokens that expire you probably do something like this:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(
    config: config,
    tokenProvider: .closure { client, completion in
      service.fetchToken { token in
        completion(token)
      }
    }
  )
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  service.fetchToken { token in
    client.connectUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId), token: token)
  }
  // `tokenProvider` property is used to reobtain a new token in case if the current one is expired
  client.tokenProvider = { completion in
    service.fetchToken { token in
      completion(token)
    }
  }
  ```

### ‚úÖ Added

_June 11, 2021_

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes from `4.0.0-beta.2`
- Due to App Store Connect suddenly starting rejecting builds, we've renamed the following funcs everywhere:

  - `didTouchUpInside` -> `handleTouchUpInside`
  - `didTap` -> `handleTap`
  - `didLongPress` -> `handleLongPress`
  - `textDidChange` -> `handleTextChange`
  If you've subclassed UI components and overridden these functions, you should rename your overrides.

# [3.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/3.0)
_January 22nd, 2021_

## StreamChat SDK reaches another milestone with version 3.0 üéâ

### New features:

* **Offline support**: Browse channels and send messages while offline.
* **First-class support for `SwiftUI` and `Combine`**: Built-it wrappers make using the SDK with the latest Apple frameworks a seamless experience.
* **Uses `UIKit` patterns and paradigms:** The API follows the design of native system SDKs. It makes integration with your existing code easy and familiar.
* Currently, 3.0 version is available only using CocoaPods. We will add support for SPM soon.

To use the new version of the framework, add to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'StreamChat', '~> 3.0'
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

In order to provide new features like offline support and `SwiftUI` wrappers, we had to make notable breaking changes to the public API of the SDKs.

**Please don't upgrade to version `3.0` before you get familiar with the changes and their impact on your codebase.**

To prevent CocoaPods from updating `StreamChat` to version 3, you can explicitly pin the SDKs to versions `2.x` in your `podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'StreamChat', '~> 2.0'
pod 'StreamChatCore', '~> 2.0' # if needed
pod 'StreamChatClient', '~> 2.0' # if needed
```

The framework naming and overall structure were changed. Since version 3.0, Stream Chat iOS SDK consists of:

#### `StreamChat` framework

Contains low-level logic and is meant to be used by users who want to build a fully custom UI. It covers functionality previously provided by `StreamChatCore` and `StreamChatClient`.

#### `StreamChat UI` framework _(currently in public beta)_

Contains a complete set of ready-to-use configurable UI elements that you can customize a use for building your own chat UI. It covers functionality previously provided by `StreamChat`.

### Sample App

The best way to explore the SDKs and their usage is our [sample app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/tree/main/Sample). It contains an example implementation of a simple IRC-style chat app using the following patterns:

* `UIKit` using delegates
* `UIKit` using reactive patterns and SDK's built-in `Combine` wrappers.
* `SwiftUI` using the SDK's built-in `ObservableObject` wrappers.
* Learn more about the sample app at its own [README](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/tree/main/Sample).
