# StreamChat iOS SDK CHANGELOG
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

# Upcoming

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes from `4.0-beta.8`
- Extra data is now stored on a hashmap and not using the `ExtraData` generic system
- `ChatMessageLayoutOptionsResolver.optionsForMessage` has a new parameter: `appearance` [#1304](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/1304)
- Renamed `Components.navigationTitleView` -> `Components.titleContainerView` [#1294](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1294)

### New Extra Data Type

The new `4.0` release changes how `extraData` is stored and uses a simpler hashmap-based solution. This approach does not require creating type aliases for all generic classes such as `ChatClient`.

Example:

```swift
client.connectUser(
    userInfo: .init(
        id: userCredentials.id,
        extraData: ["country": .string("NL")]
    ),
    token: token
)
```

`Message`, `User`, `Channel`, `MessageReaction` models now store `extraData` in a `[String: RawJSON]` container. 

```swift
let extraData:[String: RawJSON] = .dictionary([
    "name": .string(testPayload.name),
    "number": .integer(testPayload.number)
])
```

#### Upgrading from ExtraData

If you are using `ExtraData` from `v3` or before `4.0-beta.8` the steps needed to upgrade are the following:

- Remove all type aliases (`typealias ChatUser = _ChatUser<CustomExtraDataTypes.User>`)
- Replace all generic types from `StreamChat` and `StreamChatUI` classes (`__CurrentChatUserController<T>` -> `CurrentChatUserController`) with the non-generic version
- Remove the extra data structs and either use `extraData` directly or (recommended) extend the models 
- Update your views to read your custom fields from the `extraData` field

Before:

```swift
struct Birthland: UserExtraData {
    static var defaultValue = Birthland(birthLand: "")
    let birthLand: String
}
```

After:

```swift
extension ChatUser {
    static let birthLandFieldName = "birthLand"
    var birthLand: String {
        guard let v = extraData[ChatUser.birthLandFieldName] else {
            return ""
        }
        guard case let .string(birthLand) = v else {
            return ""
        }
        return birthLand
    }
}
```

_July 07, 2021_

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes from `4.0-beta.4`
- The `ChatSuggestionsViewController` was renamed to `ChatSuggestionsVC` to follow the rest of the codebase. [#1195](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1195)
- The `CreateChatChannelButton` component was removed. The component acted only as a placeholder and the functionality should be always provided by the hosting app. For an example implementation see the [Demo app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/blob/main/DemoApp/ChatPresenter.swift).
- The payload of `AnyChatMessageAttachment` changed from `Any` to `Data` [#1248](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/pull/1248).
- The user setting API was updated. It's now required to call one of the available `connect` methods on `ChatClient` after `ChatClient`'s instance is created in order to establish connection and set the current user.

  Migration tips:
  ---
  If you were doing:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: .static(token))
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  client.connectUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId), token: token)
  ```
  ---
  Guest users before:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(
    config: config,
    tokenProvider: .guest(
      userId: userId,
      name: userName
    )
  )
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  client.connectGuestUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId))
  ```
  ---
  Anonymous users before:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: .anonymous)
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  client.connectAnonymousUser()
  ```
  ---
  If you use tokens that expire you probably do something like this:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(
    config: config,
    tokenProvider: .closure { client, completion in
      service.fetchToken { token in
        completion(token)
      }
    }
  )
  ```
  Now you should do:
  ```
  let client = ChatClient(config: config)
  service.fetchToken { token in
    client.connectUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId), token: token)
  }
  // `tokenProvider` property is used to reobtain a new token in case if the current one is expired
  client.tokenProvider = { completion in
    service.fetchToken { token in
      completion(token)
    }
  }
  ```

### ‚úÖ Added

- `.contains` added to `Filter` to be able to filter for `teams` [#1206](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/1206)

### üîÑ Changed
- `shouldConnectAutomatically` setting in `ChatConfig`, it now has no effect and all logic that used it now behaves like it was set to `true`.

### üêû Fixed 
- `ConnectionController` fires its `controllerDidChangeConnectionStatus` method only when the connection status actually changes [#1207](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/1207)
- Fix cancelled ephemeral (giphy) messages and deleted messages are visible in threads [#1238](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/1238)
- Fix crash on missing `cid` value of `Message` during local cache invalidation [#1245](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/1245)
- Messages keep correct order if the local device time is different from the server time [#1246](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/issues/1246)

# [3.0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/releases/tag/3.0)
_January 22nd, 2021_

## StreamChat SDK reaches another milestone with version 3.0 üéâ

### New features:

* **Offline support**: Browse channels and send messages while offline.
* **First-class support for `SwiftUI` and `Combine`**: Built-it wrappers make using the SDK with the latest Apple frameworks a seamless experience.
* **Uses `UIKit` patterns and paradigms:** The API follows the design of native system SDKs. It makes integration with your existing code easy and familiar.
* Currently, 3.0 version is available only using CocoaPods. We will add support for SPM soon.

To use the new version of the framework, add to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'StreamChat', '~> 3.0'
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

In order to provide new features like offline support and `SwiftUI` wrappers, we had to make notable breaking changes to the public API of the SDKs.

**Please don't upgrade to version `3.0` before you get familiar with the changes and their impact on your codebase.**

To prevent CocoaPods from updating `StreamChat` to version 3, you can explicitly pin the SDKs to versions `2.x` in your `podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'StreamChat', '~> 2.0'
pod 'StreamChatCore', '~> 2.0' # if needed
pod 'StreamChatClient', '~> 2.0' # if needed
```

The framework naming and overall structure were changed. Since version 3.0, Stream Chat iOS SDK consists of:

#### `StreamChat` framework

Contains low-level logic and is meant to be used by users who want to build a fully custom UI. It covers functionality previously provided by `StreamChatCore` and `StreamChatClient`.

#### `StreamChat UI` framework _(currently in public beta)_

Contains a complete set of ready-to-use configurable UI elements that you can customize a use for building your own chat UI. It covers functionality previously provided by `StreamChat`.

### Sample App

The best way to explore the SDKs and their usage is our [sample app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/tree/main/Sample). It contains an example implementation of a simple IRC-style chat app using the following patterns:

* `UIKit` using delegates
* `UIKit` using reactive patterns and SDK's built-in `Combine` wrappers.
* `SwiftUI` using the SDK's built-in `ObservableObject` wrappers.
* Learn more about the sample app at its own [README](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/tree/main/Sample).
