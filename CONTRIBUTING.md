## Our Release flow 🚀

We make sure to follow all QA test procedure for minor and major releases. 

We accumulate changes and release them in batches, unless high priority.
We make sure to put staged changes (on master but not released in a version) as "Upcoming" in [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

If possible, we deprecate stuff before removing them directly. Deprecated stuff will be removed after a minor release, and will include a migration/upgrade guide.
