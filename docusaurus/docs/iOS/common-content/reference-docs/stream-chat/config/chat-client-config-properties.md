### `apiKey`

The `APIKey` unique for your chat app.

``` swift
public let apiKey: APIKey
```

The API key can be obtained by registering on \[our website\](https://getstream.io/chat/).

### `localStorageFolderURL`

The folder `ChatClient` uses to store its local cache files.

``` swift
public var localStorageFolderURL: URL? 
```

### `baseURL`

The datacenter `ChatClient` uses for connecting.

``` swift
public var baseURL: BaseURL = .usEast
```

### `isLocalStorageEnabled`

Determines whether `ChatClient` caches the data locally. This makes it possible to browse the existing chat data also
when the internet connection is not available.

``` swift
public var isLocalStorageEnabled: Bool = true
```

### `shouldFlushLocalStorageOnStart`

If set to `true`, `ChatClient` resets the local cache on the start.

``` swift
public var shouldFlushLocalStorageOnStart: Bool = false
```

You should set `shouldFlushLocalStorageOnStart = true` every time the changes in your code makes the local cache invalid.

For example, when you change your custom `ExtraData` types, the cached data can't be decoded, and the cache has to be
flushed.

### `localCaching`

Advanced settings for the local caching and model serialization.

``` swift
public var localCaching 
```

### `isClientInActiveMode`

Flag for setting a ChatClient instance in connection-less mode.
A connection-less client is not able to connect to websocket and will not
receive websocket events. It can still observe and mutate database.
This flag is automatically set to `false` for app extensions
**Warning**:â€‹ There should be at max 1 active client at the same time, else it can lead to undefined behavior.

``` swift
public var isClientInActiveMode: Bool
```

### `shouldConnectAutomatically`

If set to `true` the `ChatClient` will automatically establish a web-socket
connection to listen to the updates when `reloadUserIfNeeded` is called.

``` swift
public var shouldConnectAutomatically = true
```

If set to `false` the connection won't be established automatically
but has to be initiated manually by calling `connect`.

Is `true` by default.

### `staysConnectedInBackground`

If set to `true`, the `ChatClient` will try to stay connected while app is backgrounded.
If set to `false`, websocket disconnects immediately when app is backgrounded.

``` swift
public var staysConnectedInBackground = true
```

This flag aims to reduce unnecessary reconnections while quick app switches,
like when a user just checks a notification or another app.
`ChatClient` starts a background task to keep the connection alive,
and disconnects when background task expires.
`ChatClient` tries to stay connected while in background up to 5 minutes.
Usually, disconnection occurs around 2-3 minutes.

> 

Default value is `true`

### `customCDNClient`

Creates a new instance of `ChatClientConfig`.

``` swift
public var customCDNClient: CDNClient?
```

Allows to inject a custom API client for uploading attachments, if not specified `StreamCDNClient` is used
