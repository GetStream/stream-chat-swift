## Enumeration Cases

### `regular`

A regular message created in the channel.

``` swift
case regular
```

### `ephemeral`

are normally used by commands (for example /giphy) to prompt messages or request for actions.

``` swift
case ephemeral
```

history and is only delivered to one user.

``` swift
case error
```

### `reply`

The message is a reply to another message. Use the `parentMessageId` variable of the message to get the parent
message data.

``` swift
case reply
```

### `system`

A message generated by a system event, like updating the channel or muting a user.

``` swift
case system
```
