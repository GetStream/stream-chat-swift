### `delegate`

``` swift
var delegate: CurrentChatUserControllerDelegate? 
```

## Methods

### `synchronize(_:)`

Synchronize local data with remote. Waits for the client to connect but doesnâ€™t initiate the connection itself.
This is to make sure the fetched local data is up-to-date, since the current user data is updated through WebSocket events.

``` swift
override public func synchronize(_ completion: ((_ error: Error?) -> Void)? = nil) 
```

#### Parameters

  - `completion`: Called when the controller has finished fetching the local data and the client connection is established.

### `reloadUserIfNeeded(completion:)`

Fetches the token from `tokenProvider` and prepares the current `ChatClient` variables
for the new user.

``` swift
func reloadUserIfNeeded(completion: ((Error?) -> Void)? = nil) 
```

If the a token obtained from `tokenProvider` is for another user the
database will be flushed.

#### Parameters

  - `completion`: The completion to be called when the operation is completed.

### `updateUserData(name:imageURL:userExtraData:completion:)`

Updates the current user data.

``` swift
func updateUserData(
        name: String? = nil,
        imageURL: URL? = nil,
        userExtraData: [String: RawJSON] = [:],
        completion: ((Error?) -> Void)? = nil
    ) 
```

By default all data is `nil`, and it won't be updated unless a value is provided.

#### Parameters

  - `name`: Optionally provide a new name to be updated.
  - `imageURL`: Optionally provide a new image to be updated.
  - `userExtraData`: Optionally provide new user extra data to be updated.
  - `completion`: Called when user is successfully updated, or with error.

### `synchronizeDevices(completion:)`

Fetches the most updated devices and syncs with the local database.

``` swift
func synchronizeDevices(completion: ((Error?) -> Void)? = nil) 
```

#### Parameters

  - `completion`: Called when the devices are synced successfully, or with error.

### `addDevice(token:completion:)`

Registers a device to the current user.
`setUser` must be called before calling this.

``` swift
func addDevice(token: Data, completion: ((Error?) -> Void)? = nil) 
```

#### Parameters

  - `token`: Device token, obtained via `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` function in `AppDelegate`.
  - `completion`: Called when device is successfully registered, or with error.

### `removeDevice(id:completion:)`

`setUser` must be called before calling this.

``` swift
func removeDevice(id: String, completion: ((Error?) -> Void)? = nil) 
```

#### Parameters

  - `id`: Device id to be removed. You can obtain registered devices via `currentUser.devices`. If `currentUser.devices` is not up-to-date, please make an `synchronize` call.
  - `completion`: Called when device is successfully deregistered, or with error.

### `setDelegate(_:)`

Sets the provided object as a delegate of this controller.

``` swift
func setDelegate<Delegate: CurrentChatUserControllerDelegate>(_ delegate: Delegate?) 
```

#### Parameters
