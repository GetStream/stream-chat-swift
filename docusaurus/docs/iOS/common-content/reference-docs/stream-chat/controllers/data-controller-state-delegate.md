A delegate protocol some Controllers use to propagate the information about controller `state` changes. You can use it to let
users know a certain activity is happening in the background, for example using a non-blocking activity indicator.

``` swift
public protocol DataControllerStateDelegate: AnyObject 
```

## Inheritance

``` swift
func controller(_ controller: DataController, didChangeState state: DataController.State)
```
