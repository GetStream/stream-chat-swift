title: ChatChannelController
---

`ChatChannelController` is a controller class which allows mutating and observing changes of a specific chat channel.

``` swift
public class ChatChannelController: DataController, DelegateCallable, DataStoreProvider 
```

`ChatChannelController` objects are lightweight, and they can be used for both, continuous data change observations (like
getting new messages in the channel), and for quick channel mutations (like adding a member to a channel).

## Inheritance

[`DataController`](../../data-controller), [`DelegateCallable`](../../delegate-callable), [`DataStoreProvider`](../../../database/data-store-provider)

## Properties

### `statePublisher`

A publisher emitting a new value every time the state of the controller changes.

``` swift
public var statePublisher: AnyPublisher<DataController.State, Never> 
```

### `channelChangePublisher`

A publisher emitting a new value every time the channel changes.

``` swift
public var channelChangePublisher: AnyPublisher<EntityChange<ChatChannel>, Never> 
```

### `messagesChangesPublisher`

A publisher emitting a new value every time the list of the messages matching the query changes.

``` swift
public var messagesChangesPublisher: AnyPublisher<[ListChange<ChatMessage>], Never> 
```

### `memberEventPublisher`

A publisher emitting a new value every time member event received.

``` swift
public var memberEventPublisher: AnyPublisher<MemberEvent, Never> 
```

### `typingUsersPublisher`

A publisher emitting a new value every time typing users change.

``` swift
public var typingUsersPublisher: AnyPublisher<Set<ChatUser>, Never> 
```

### `observableObject`

A wrapper object that exposes the controller variables in the form of `ObservableObject` to be used in SwiftUI.

``` swift
public var observableObject: ObservableObject 
```

### `channelQuery`

The ChannelQuery this controller observes.

``` swift
@Atomic public private(set) var channelQuery: ChannelQuery
```

### `hasLoadedAllPreviousMessages`

A Boolean value that returns whether the previous messages have all been loaded or not.

``` swift
public private(set) var hasLoadedAllPreviousMessages: Bool = false
```

### `cid`

The identifier of a channel this controller observes.
Will be `nil` when we want to create direct message channel and `id`
is not yet generated by backend.

``` swift
public var cid: ChannelId? 
```

### `client`

The `ChatClient` instance this controller belongs to.

``` swift
public let client: ChatClient
```

### `channel`

The channel the controller represents.

``` swift
public var channel: ChatChannel? 
```

To observe changes of the channel, set your class as a delegate of this controller or use the provided
`Combine` publishers.

### `messages`

The messages of the channel the controller represents.

``` swift
public var messages: LazyCachedMapCollection<ChatMessage> 
```

To observe changes of the messages, set your class as a delegate of this controller or use the provided
`Combine` publishers.

### `messageOrdering`

Describes the ordering the messages are presented.

``` swift
public let messageOrdering: MessageOrdering
```

### `areTypingEventsEnabled`

`true` if the channel has typing events enabled. Defaults to `false` if the channel doesn't exist yet.

``` swift
var areTypingEventsEnabled: Bool 
```

### `areReactionsEnabled`

`true` if the channel has reactions enabled. Defaults to `false` if the channel doesn't exist yet.

``` swift
var areReactionsEnabled: Bool 
```

### `areRepliesEnabled`

`true` if the channel has replies enabled. Defaults to `false` if the channel doesn't exist yet.

``` swift
var areRepliesEnabled: Bool 
```

### `areReadEventsEnabled`

`true` if the channel has read events enabled. Defaults to `false` if the channel doesn't exist yet.

``` swift
var areReadEventsEnabled: Bool 
```

### `areUploadsEnabled`

`true` if the channel supports uploading files/images. Defaults to `false` if the channel doesn't exist yet.

``` swift
var areUploadsEnabled: Bool 
```

### `delegate`

Set the delegate of `ChannelController` to observe the changes in the system.

``` swift
var delegate: ChatChannelControllerDelegate? 
```
