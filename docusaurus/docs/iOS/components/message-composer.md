The Message Composer component provides all the UI and necessary functionality for composing a message. It supports sending text, adding commands, typing suggestions for user mentions and commands, uploading attachments like images, giphy's, files and video. The `ComposerVC` is the class responsible for the functionality of the composer, where the `ComposerView` is responsible for the UI layout. Both the `ComposerVC` and the `ComposerView` are totally customizable so that you can provide your own UI or extend the existing functionality.

## Composer View
The composer view is represented by the `ComposerView` class which holds all the composer subviews and implements the composer layout. The composer layout is built with multiple `ContainerStackView`'s, which are very similar how  `UIStackView`'s work, you can read more about them [here](../customization/custom-components#setuplayout). This makes it very customizable since to change the layout you only need to move/remove/add views from different containers.

In the picture below you can see all the containers and main views of the composer:

## Composer Content

The `ComposerVC.Content` is a struct that contains all the data that will be part of the composed message. It contains the current `text` of the message, the `attachments`, the `threadMessage` in case you are inside a Thread, the `command` if you are sending for example a Giphy, and the `state` of the composer to determine whether you are creating, editing or quoting a message. 

### Properties

## Composer State
The composer has three different states, `.new`, `.edit` and `.quote`. The `.new` state is when the composer is creating a new message, the `.edit` state is when we are editing an existing message and changing it's content, and finally, the `.quote` state is when we are replying a message inline (not in a thread). In the table below we can see the composer in all the three different states:

| `.new`  | `.edit` | `.quote` |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src={require("../assets/composer-ui-state-new.png").default} width="100%"/> | <img src={require("../assets/composer-ui-state-edit.png").default} width="100%"/> | <img src={require("../assets/composer-ui-state-quote.png").default} width="100%"/> |

## Customization

The `ComposerVC` and `ComposerView` are completely customizable. You can not only change the UI layout and styling, but you can extend the composer functionality as well. In case you want to change the styling, adding new views and new functionality you can take a look at the [Customize Message Composer](../guides/customize-message-composer) guide. If you want to add a new custom attachment and make the composer to support it, you should read the [Message Composer Custom Attachments](../guides/working-with-custom-attachments) guide.
