The `ComposerVC` is the component responsible to create new messages or change existing messages. The composer belongs to the `ChatMessageListVC` component that integrates the message list and the composer in one view. But if you are not using our `ChatMessageListVC` you can use the composer component in isolation with your own chat view as well. The `ComposerVC` manages all the logic and actions of the `ComposerView`, where the latter is only responsible for the composer's layout.

## How to Change the Composer Layout
Since the `ComposerView` is responsible for the composer's layout, if you want to change the styling, the position of the views, removing views or adding new ones, you need to override the `ComposerView`. Let's go through an example of customizing the composer to look like the iMessage app. The iMessage's composer is quite different than the composer that comes with the SDK: there is only one button to add pictures/videos and the send button is inside the input text container.

| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src={require("../../assets/composer-imessage-ui-before.png").default}/> | <img src={require("../../assets/composer-imessage-ui-after.png").default}/> |

After changing the layout through the following steps you should have the result of the picture above.

First thing we need to do is to subclass the `ComposerView` and change it's layout. To have a better understand of how the `ComposerView`'s layout is structured it is recommended to read this page first, [here](../../components/message-composer#composer-view).
```swift
class iMessageComposerView: ComposerView {
    override func setUpLayout() {
        super.setUpLayout()

        // Move the send button from the trailing container to input container
        trailingContainer.removeArrangedSubview(sendButton)
        inputMessageView.inputTextContainer.addArrangedSubview(sendButton)

        // Remove spacing in leading container for bigger attachment button
        leadingContainer.spacing = 0

        // Make send button inside input container aligned to bottom
        inputMessageView.inputTextContainer.alignment = .bottom

        // Make the attachment button (camera button) bigger
        attachmentButton.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 30).isActive = true
        attachmentButton.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 30).isActive = true
    }

    override func layoutSubviews() {
        super.layoutSubviews()

        // Adjust the input corner radius to make the input rounder
        inputMessageView.container.layer.cornerRadius = 18
    }
}
```

To remove the commands button, we disable the commands feature by subclassing `ComposerVC` and overriding `isCommandsEnabled` property, which can also be disabled by the Stream's Dashboard.
```swift
class iMessageComposerVC: ComposerVC {

    override var isCommandsEnabled: Bool {
        false
    }
}
```

Then, we need to replace the default components with our custom ones:
```swift
Components.default.messageComposerView = iMessageComposerView.self
Components.default.messageComposerVC = iMessageComposerVC.self
```
<ComponentsNote/>

Finally, we replace the default attachments button icon with a camera icon:
```swift
Appearance.default.images.openAttachments = UIImage(systemName: "camera.fill")!.withTintColor(.systemBlue)
```
<ThemingNote/>

## How to add a new Composer Action
All the actions triggered by the Composer buttons are wired in the `ComposerVC.setUp()` lifecycle. When adding new buttons it is possible to add new actions by overriding this function. Let's pick the iMessage example and add an emoji button to the composer to open an Emoji picker.

First, we need to add the emoji button to the `ComposerView`:
```swift
class iMessageComposerView: ComposerView {

    lazy var emojiButton: UIButton = {
        let button = UIButton()
        button.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        button.setImage(UIImage(systemName: "face.smiling.fill"), for: .normal)
        return button
    }()

    override func setUpLayout() {
        super.setUpLayout()
        ...

        // Add the emoji button to the left side of attachment button
        leadingContainer.insertArrangedSubview(emojiButton, at: 0)
        // Make the emoji button same size as attachment button
        emojiButton.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 30).isActive = true
        emojiButton.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 30).isActive = true
    }
```

| Before  | After |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src={require("../../assets/composer-imessage-ui-after.png").default}/> | <img src={require("../../assets/composer-imessage-emoji.png").default}/> |

Now, that we have our emoji button in the composer view, we need to setup an action for it and handle the logic of the new emoji picker. For this, we need to subclass the `ComposerVC` and override the `setUp()` function to add a new action and override `updateContent()` to hide the emoji button when the input text is empty.

```swift
class iMessageComposerVC: ComposerVC {

    // We need to cast the composerView to our new `iMessageComposerView`
    // so that we can have access to the new `emojiButton`.
    var iMessageComposerView: iMessageComposerView {
        composerView as! iMessageComposerView
    }

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()

        // Add a target action to the emoji button
        iMessageComposerView
            .emojiButton
            .addTarget(self, action: #selector(showEmojiPicker), for: .touchUpInside)
    }

    @objc func showEmojiPicker(sender: UIButton) {

        // For the sake of making the guide simple,
        // we use an alert controller to select emojis.
        let sheetAlertController = UIAlertController(
            title: "Emoji Picker",
            message: nil,
            preferredStyle: .actionSheet
        )

        ["ðŸ˜ƒ", "ðŸ˜‡", "ðŸ˜…", "ðŸ˜‚"].forEach { emoji in

            let action = UIAlertAction(title: emoji, style: .default) { _ in
                let inputTextView = self.composerView.inputMessageView.textView
                // Populate the emoji in the input view where is the caret position
                inputTextView.replaceSelectedText(emoji)
            }

            sheetAlertController.addAction(action)
        }

        present(sheetAlertController, animated: true)
    }

    override func updateContent() {
        super.updateContent()

        // Hide the emojiButton when the input text is not empty (Input expands)
        self.iMessageComposerView.emojiButton.isHidden = !self.content.text.isEmpty
    }
}
```

Finally, replace the custom component:

```swift
Components.default.messageComposerVC = iMessageComposerVC.self
Components.default.messageComposerView = iMessageComposerView.self
```

After customizing the `ComposerVC` with the changes above you should now have an emoji picker when tapping the emoji button. To make the guide simple, we used an `UIAlertController` for the emoji picker but you can create your own custom emoji picker.

## Customizing Typing Suggestions
When typing on the composer, if you type `@` it will present a view suggesting users that you can mention, or if you type `/` as the first character, it will show command suggestions. You can customize not only the UI of the suggestions but also the logic around it, as well as disable this feature.

### Disabling the Suggestions
Your app might not want to support suggestions at all like the iMessage app, or want to support only one of the suggestions available. You can disable the suggestions feature by just returning `nil` on the following functions:

```swift
class iMessageComposerVC: ComposerVC {

    override func typingMention(in textView: UITextView) -> (String, NSRange)? {
        return nil
    }

    override func typingCommand(in textView: UITextView) -> String? {
        return nil
    }
}
```

### Changing the Suggestions UI
The UI SDK provides a `ChatSuggestionsVC` component responsible for showing user suggestions and commands suggestions.

#### Customizing the Suggestions Container
In case you only want to change the styling of the container that shows both suggestions, you can override the `ChatSuggestionsVC`. Here is an example of a basic customization of the container component:
```swift
class CustomChatSuggestionsVC: ChatSuggestionsVC {
    override func setUpAppearance() {
        super.setUpAppearance()

        collectionView.layer.borderWidth = 1
        collectionView.layer.borderColor = appearance.colorPalette.border.cgColor
        view.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.0
    }

    override func layoutSubviews() {
        super.layoutSubviews()
        collectionView.layer.cornerRadius = 10
    }
}
```

Then, replace the custom component:

```swift
Components.default.suggestionsVC = CustomChatSuggestionsVC.self
```

Here we simply remove the shadow and customize the border style of the suggestions component.

| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src={require("../../assets/composer-suggestionsVC-before.png").default} /> | <img src={require("../../assets/composer-suggestionsVC-after.png").default} /> |

#### Customizing the Suggestions Cells
If you want to further customize the suggestions UI and want to change the suggestions cells, the recommended way is to subclass the `ChatMentionSuggestionView` and `ChatCommandSuggestionView` components. Let's see an example of how we can change the user mention cell by remove the username and the "@" symbol:

```swift
class CustomMentionSuggestionView: ChatMentionSuggestionView {

    override func setUpLayout() {
        super.setUpLayout()

        textContainer.removeArrangedSubview(usernameTagLabel)
        mentionSymbolImageView.removeFromSuperview()
    }
}
```

Then, replace the custom component:
```swift
Components.default.suggestionsMentionView = CustomMentionSuggestionView.self
```

| Before  | After |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src={require("../../assets/composer-suggestionsVC-after.png").default} /> | <img src={require("../../assets/composer-suggestionsVC-custom-cell.png").default} /> |

#### Bypassing how the Suggestions are Presented
Finally, if you need to have complete control over how the suggestions are presented and not use our `ChatSuggestionsVC` component you can by overriding the following functions:
```swift
class CustomComposerVC: ComposerVC {
    override func showMentionSuggestions(for typingMention: String, mentionRange: NSRange) {
        // Add your custom implementation to show mention suggestions
    }

    override func showCommandSuggestions(for typingCommand: String) {
        // Add your custom implementation to show command suggestions
    }
}
```
