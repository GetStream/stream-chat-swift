title: Migrating from 3.x to 4.x
---

The major version bump is due to the presence of several breaking changes. We believe they are easy to take care of in the upgrade process and improve the design of the library.

---
Please don't hesitate to contact us by sending an email to support@getstream.io or opening a ticket in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift). We'll help you during your migration process and any issues you might face.

## What's New in v4.x?

- UI components have an open API and are fully customizable. Review [UI Customization Guide](ui-customization.md) to learn more about how to customize UI components.
- Messages can have custom attachments. See [Attachments v4.x Migration](#attachments-v4x-migration) below.
- ExtraData is now stored in a Dictionary, instead of using generics. See [ExtraData Changes](#extradata-changes) below.
- `UIConfig` is split into `Appearance` and `Components` to improve clarity.
-  The user setting API was updated. See [New User Setting API](#new-user-setting-api) below.
- The inner structure of the UI components has been simplified. Many UI components were renamed.
- `DefaultAppearance` API was removed due to its difficulty of usage.
- The majority of the UI components use `ContainerStackView` (our custom `UIStackView` re-implementation) for its layout.


For the list of all changes, please check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
## New User Setting API

The user setting API was completely changed in v4. Here are the comparisons:

### Static Tokens
v3:
```swift
let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: .static(token))
```

v4:
```swift
let client = ChatClient(config: config)
client.connectUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId), token: token)
```

### Closure-based Tokens
v3:
```swift
let client = ChatClient(
  config: config,
  tokenProvider: .closure { client, completion in
    service.fetchToken { token in
      completion(token)
    }
  }
)
```

v4:
```swift
// `tokenProvider` property is used to reobtain a new token in case if the current one is expired
let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: { completion in
  service.fetchToken { token in
    completion(token)
  }
})
service.fetchToken { token in
  client.connectUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId), token: token)
}
```

### Development Users
v3:
```swift
let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: .development(userId))
```

v4:
```swift
let client = ChatClient(config: config)
client.connectUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId), token: .development(userId))
```

### Guest / Anonymous Users
v3:
```swift
let client = ChatClient(
  config: config,
  tokenProvider: .guest(
    userId: userId,
    name: userName
  )
)
// or
let client = ChatClient(config: config, tokenProvider: .anonymous)
```

v4:
```swift
let client = ChatClient(config: config)
client.connectGuestUser(userInfo: .init(id: userId))
// or
client.connectAnonymousUser()
```

## ExtraData Changes

The new `4.0` release changes how `extraData` is stored and uses a simpler hashmap-based solution. This approach does not require creating type aliases for all generic classes such as `ChatClient`.

Example:

```swift
client.connectUser(
    userInfo: .init(
        id: userCredentials.id,
        extraData: ["country": .string("NL")]
    ),
    token: token
)
```

`Message`, `User`, `Channel`, `MessageReaction` models now store `extraData` in a `[String: RawJSON]` container. 

```swift
let extraData:[String: RawJSON] = .dictionary([
    "name": .string(testPayload.name),
    "number": .integer(testPayload.number)
])
```

### Upgrading from ExtraData

If you are using `ExtraData` from `v3` or before `4.0-beta.8` the steps needed to upgrade are the following:

- Remove all type aliases (`typealias ChatUser = _ChatUser<CustomExtraDataTypes.User>`)
- Replace all generic types from `StreamChat` and `StreamChatUI` classes (`__CurrentChatUserController<T>` -> `CurrentChatUserController`) with the non-generic version
- Remove the extra data structs and either use `extraData` directly or (recommended) extend the models 
- Update your views to read your custom fields from the `extraData` field

v3:
```swift
struct Birthland: UserExtraData {
    static var defaultValue = Birthland(birthLand: "")
    let birthLand: String
}
```

v4:
```swift
extension ChatUser {
    static let birthLandFieldName = "birthLand"
    var birthLand: String {
        guard let v = extraData[ChatUser.birthLandFieldName] else {
            return ""
        }
        guard case let .string(birthLand) = v else {
            return ""
        }
        return birthLand
    }
}
```

## Attachments v4.x Migration

### Sending Attachments

In both `v4.x` and `v3.2` the sequence of steps is the same:
- **[1]** create a controller for the channel the message should be sent to
- **[2]** create attachments that should be added to the message
- **[3]** send the message with attachments using the controller

```swift {7-9}
// [1] Create a controller
let channelController = ChatChannelController(
    for: ChannelId(type: .messaging, id: "general")
)

// [2] Create attachments (ðŸš¨ has changed in `v4.x`)
let attachments = [
  ...
]

// [3] Send the message
channelController.createNewMessage(
    text: "Hey, have a look at this one",
    attachments: attachments,
    completion: { result in
      // handle the result
      print(result)
    }
)
```

Let's see how to create **file/image** and **custom** attachments in `v4.x` and make the compiler happy.

#### File/image Attachments

`Version 3.x`
```swift
// Create an array of `AttachmentEnvelope` objects
let attachments: [AttachmentEnvelope] = [
  // Add file attachment by creating `ChatMessageAttachmentSeed`
  ChatMessageAttachmentSeed(localURL: fileURL, type: .file),
  // Add image attachment by creating `ChatMessageAttachmentSeed`
  ChatMessageAttachmentSeed(localURL: imageURL, type: .image)
]
```

`Version 4.x`
```swift
// Create an array of `AnyAttachmentPayload` objects
let attachments: [AnyAttachmentPayload] = [
  // Add file attachment by creating `AnyAttachmentPayload`
  try AnyAttachmentPayload(localFileURL: fileURL, attachmentType: .file),
  // Add image attachment by creating `AnyAttachmentPayload`
  try AnyAttachmentPayload(localFileURL: imageURL, attachmentType: .image)
]
```

The `.file` and `.image` attachments are the only built-in attachment types that can be added to the message manually.

#### Custom Attachments

To add a custom attachments to the message the custom type has to be created first.
This is true for both `v3.2` and `v4.x` however there are some differences so let's see what they are:

`Version 3.x`
```swift
// Declare a custom type conforming to `AttachmentEnvelope`
struct Product: AttachmentEnvelope {
    let type: AttachmentType = .custom("product")

    let name: String
    let price: Int
}

// Create a custom attachment
let iPhone = Product(name: "iPhone 12 Pro", price: 999)

// Create an array of `AttachmentEnvelope` objects
let attachments: [AttachmentEnvelope] = [
  // Add custom attachment instance directly
  iPhone
]
```

`Version 4.x`
```swift
// Declare a custom type conforming to `AttachmentPayload`
struct Product: AttachmentPayload {
    static let type: AttachmentType = "product"

    let name: String
    let price: Int
}

// Create an attachment payload
let iPhone = Product(name: "iPhone 12 Pro", price: 999)

// Create an array of `AnyAttachmentPayload` objects
let attachments: [AnyAttachmentPayload] = [
  // Create `AnyAttachmentPayload` that wraps custom attachment payload
  AnyAttachmentPayload(payload: iPhone)
]
```

#### Summary

| `v3.2` | `v4.x` |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| An array of `AttachmentEnvelope` objects is passed when creating a message | An array of `AnyAttachmentPayload` is passed when creating a message |
| Attachments of `.file/.image` type are added via `ChatMessageAttachmentSeed` | Attachments of `.file/.image` type are added via `AnyAttachmentPayload` |
| Custom attachment must conform to `AttachmentEnvelope` protocol and can be directly passed to `createMessage` | Custom attachment must conform to `AttachmentPayload` protocol and wrapped by `AnyAttachmentPayload` before passing to `createMessage` |

### Get attachments

In both `v4.x` and `v3.2` the sequence of steps is the same:
- **[1]** get a `ChatMessage` model ([Working with messages](working-with-messages.md))
- **[2]** get all attachments of the required type
- **[3]** access attachment fields

Let's see how at steps **[2]** and **[3]** look in `v4.x` for different kind of attachments.

#### File Attachments

File attachment requires prior uploading before the message is sent. The local state is exposed for `.file` attachments to track how the uploading goes.

`Version 3.x`
```swift
// Get `.file` attachments
let fileAttachments = message.attachments
  .compactMap { $0 as? ChatMessageDefaultAttachment }
  .filter { $0.type == .file }

// Get the first attachment
if let file = fileAttachments.first {
  if let localState = file.localState, let localURL = file.localURL {
    // Attachment is being uploaded, use local URL to show a preview
    print(localState, localURL)
  } else if let fileURL = file.url {
    // Attachment is uploaded, use remote url
    print(fileURL)
  }
}
```

`Version 4.x`
```swift
// Get the first `.file` attachment
if let file = message.fileAttachments.first {
  // Show file preview url. If attachment is being uploaded this will be the local URL.
  print(file.assetURL)

  if let uploadingState = file.uploadingState {
    // Attachment is being uploaded, handle uploading progress
    print(uploadingState)
  }
}
```

#### Image Attachments

Image attachment requires prior uploading before the message is sent. The local state is exposed for `.image` attachments to track how the uploading goes.

`Version 3.x`

Image attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageDefaultAttachment`. Mandatory fields are **optional** because of `ChatMessageDefaultAttachment` being used for all built-in attachment types.

```swift
// Get `.image` attachments
let imageAttachments = message.attachments
  .compactMap { $0 as? ChatMessageDefaultAttachment }
  .filter { $0.type == .image }

// Get the first attachment
if let image = imageAttachments.first {
  if let localState = image.localState, let localURL = image.localURL {
    // Attachment is being uploaded, use local URL to show a preview
    print(localState, localURL)
  } else if let imageURL = image.imageURL {
    // Attachment is uploaded, use remote url
    print(imageURL)
  }
}
```

`Version 4.x`

Image attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageImageAttachment`. Mandatory fields are **non-optional** and can be accessed directly on attachment.

```swift
// Get the first `.image` attachment
if let image = message.imageAttachments.first {
  // Show a preview
  print(image.previewURL)

  if let uploadingState = image.uploadingState {
    // Attachment is being uploaded, handle uploading progress
    print(uploadingState)
  }
}
```

#### Giphy Attachments

The ephemeral message containing giphy attachment will be created when `/giphy` command is used.

`Version 3.x`

Giphy attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageDefaultAttachment`. Mandatory fields are **optional** because of `ChatMessageDefaultAttachment` being used for all built-in attachment types.

```swift
// Get `.giphy` attachments
let giphyAttachments = message.attachments
  .compactMap { $0 as? ChatMessageDefaultAttachment }
  .filter { $0.type == .giphy }

// Get the first attachments
if let giphy = giphyAttachments.first {
  // Unwrap gif URL
  if let gifURL = giphy.imageURL {
    // Load and show gif
    print(gifURL)
  }
}
```

`Version 4.x`

Giphy attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageGiphyAttachment`. Mandatory fields are **non-optional** and can be accessed directly on attachment.

```swift
// Get the first `.giphy` attachment
if let giphy = message.giphyAttachments.first {
  // Load and show gif right away
  print(giphy.previewURL)
}
```

#### Link Preview Attachments

The link attachment will be added to the message automatically if the message is sent with the text containing the URL.

`Version 3.x`

Giphy attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageDefaultAttachment`. Mandatory fields are **optional** because of `ChatMessageDefaultAttachment` being used for all built-in attachment types.

```swift
// Get `.link(...)` attachments
let linkAttachments = message.attachments
  .compactMap { $0 as? ChatMessageDefaultAttachment }
  .filter { $0.type.isLink }

// Get the first attachment
if let link = linkAttachments.first {
  // Unwrap the URL
  if let url = link.url {
    // Show preview for url
    print(url)
  }
}
```

`Version 4.x`

Link preview attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageLinkAttachment`. Mandatory fields are **non-optional** and can be accessed directly on attachment.

```swift
// Get the first `.linkPreview` attachment
if let linkPreview = message.linkAttachments.first {
  // Handle the link
  print(linkPreview.originalURL)
}
```

#### Custom Attachments

`Version 3.x`

- all built-in attachments exposed as `ChatMessageRawAttachment`
- custom payload is stored in `data: Data?` fields
- custom data should be decoded manually `data`
- attachment `id` is optional

```swift
// Custom attachment type has to be `Decodable`
extension Product: Decodable { /* ... */ }

// Get attachments of custom type
let productAttachments = message.attachments
  .compactMap { $0 as? ChatMessageRawAttachment }
  .filter { $0.type == .custom("product") }

// Get first custom attachment
if let productAttachment = productAttachments.first {
  // Unwrap attachment data
  if let productData = productAttachment.data {
    // Try to decode the custom type from data
    let product = try JSONDecoder().decode(Product.self, from: productData)
    // Handle custom attachment payload
    print(product)
  }
}
```

`Version 4.x`

- custom attachments are directly accessible on `ChatMessage`
- custom payload fields are directly on attachment thanks to `dynamicMemberLookup`
- attachment `id` is not-optional ðŸŽ‰

```swift

// It's recommended but not required to create a typealias for custom attachment type to avoid generic stuff
typealias ProductAttachment = _ChatMessageAttachment<Product>

// Get attachments of custom type
let productAttachments = message.attachments(payloadType: Product.self)

// Get first custom attachment
if let product = productAttachments.first {
  // Access the payload fields right away
  print(product.name)
}
```

### Changes Summary

| `v3.2` | `v4.x` |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `ChatMessage` has a single `attachments` field | `ChatMessage` has multiple fields one for each attachment type (`imageAttachments/giphyAttachments/etc.`) |
| Built-in attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageDefaultAttachment` with mandatory fields being **optional** | Built-in attachments are exposed as arrays `_ChatMessageAttachment<Payload>` with concrete payload type with mandatory fields being **non-optional** |
| To be exposed on the message custom attachment must conform to `ChatMessageAttachment` protocol | In order attachment can be exposed on the message it's payload must conform to `AttachmentPayload` protocol |
| Custom attachments are exposed as `ChatMessageRawAttachment` | Custom attachments are exposed the same way built-in attachments are |
