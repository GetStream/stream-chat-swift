An underlying type for status in the view.
Right now corresponding functionality in LLC is missing and it will likely be replaced with the type from LLC.

``` swift
public enum Status 
```

## Enumeration Cases

### `read`

``` swift
case read, unread, empty
```

### `empty`

``` swift
case read, unread, empty
```

### `unread`

``` swift
case read, unread, empty
```
