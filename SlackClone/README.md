# 📲 Stream Chat Slack Clone App

**WARNING**

This work is currently WIP and it is subject to change.

In `SlackClone` folder you can find the source code for Slack clone. This app copies some, but not all, features that Slack iOS app offers. It is meant to show off the customizability of StreamChat UI SDK and to be of inspiration for developers working with this SDK.
