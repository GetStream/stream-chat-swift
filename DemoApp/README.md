### 1. Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `StreamChat.xcodeproj` on Xcode.
3. Wait for Swift Package Manager to install dependencies.
4. Select the `DemoApp` target and run in your preferred device.

### 2. Login

The login screen is the initial screen. It displays a list of pre-configured users that you can choose from to access our test server and interact with it using the default UI components. At the very bottom of the list, you can tap "Advanced options" to log in to a different server using custom user credentials. To generate a user token (JWT), you need your app's secret and one of the server-side SDKs or this [JWT generator](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/token_generator/?language=js).

### 3. Chat

After logging in with a user, you'll be directed to the first screen which is the `ChatChannelListViewController`. It will display the channels that your test user is a part of. By tapping any of the channels, you'll access the actual chat screen which is the `ChatChannelViewController`.

#### UI Overview

This demo app is built on top of StreamChatUI. It provides local database logic and API calls, provided by the StreamChat dependency, as well as UIKit components. Use StreamChatUI if you want a ready-made
fully-featured UI with some customizability options.
